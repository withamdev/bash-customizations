# bash-customizations

Made a bash script that gets a section of hipster ipsum from the API provided by hipsum.co and copies it to the clipboard with xclip

I found a good resource from (@shanelonergan) on how to make custom Bash scripts at https://shanelonergan.github.io/streamline-your-workflow-with-custom-bash-commands/

seeing his shell I decided to try to emulate it... and ended up falling down a rabbithole, this is his:

and this is where mine ended up:

these files are linked as sources in .bashrc, and while it does say pretty clearly in the vanilla file:

\# \# uncomment for a colored prompt, if the terminal has the capability; turned<br>
\# \# off by default to not distract the user: the focus in a terminal window<br>
\# \# should be on the output of commands, not on the prompt

I think I learned a lot about bash in the process of making my terminal window a threat to my focus.

and I think the person who wrote that could get away with being a little less judgey.
